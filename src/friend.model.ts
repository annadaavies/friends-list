 * IMPORTANT:
 * Actually, you need to npm install two packages to define a DTO for doing a validation of

 * And using a class to define a dto instead of a interface because interfaces disappear
 * during compilation, as itâ€™s native to TypeScript and doesn't exist in JavaScript.
 *
 * You can refer this website to define your dto:
 * https://dev.to/davidekete/understanding-data-transfer-objects-dto-and-data-validation-in-typescript-nestjs-1j2b
 *
 * For now, you dont have a real DB, so you can just see the the part of writing a user-auth schema
 * in above article as a reference only.
